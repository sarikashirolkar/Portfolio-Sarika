Drop your event photos in this folder.

Recommended:
- Use JPG or WebP
- Name them: event-1.jpg, event-2.jpg, ...
- Landscape works best (e.g. 1600x900)

The carousel on the Profile section will automatically pick up:
- assets/events/event-1.*
- assets/events/event-2.*
- assets/events/event-3.*
- assets/events/event-4.*
- assets/events/event-5.*
